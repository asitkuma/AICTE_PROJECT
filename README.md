# AICTE_PROJECT
It is very simple project which i did..simply i used a module pynput and inside that module i used a submodule named keyboard.where two classes are basically there one is key and another is Listner and its name itself saying that one is responsible for what u r typing another one is for listen... in this code i used three function one is responsible for to store what u r typing.And another one is for writing in each step what u r clicking it will fetch the data from list.and convert it into the string and simply insert into the file.and another one is for .if by any change if you want to stop the capturing so .esc is a prebuilt method is there where if u click esc then program ends or u can say that it allows main thread to end the program...
